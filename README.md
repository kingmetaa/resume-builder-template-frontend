## Quick Start

**Start the development**

-   `git clone git@github.com:kingmetaa/resume-builder-template-frontend.git`
-   `npm install`
-   `npm start`
-   open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
-   You will need to run the backend code on the port of :8000, if you use the port other than :8000, you will need to
    find and replace all "localhost:8000" for the entire folder

If you are finished with running localhost:3000 and localhost:8000, you can start playing around

NB: You will need to register user first!
